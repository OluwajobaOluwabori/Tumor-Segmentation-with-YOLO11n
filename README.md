# Tumor-Segmentation-with-YOLO11n

The goal of this task was to train a YOLOv11 segmentation model to detect and segment primary tumor and metastasis from 3D CT scans. I used a subset of anonymized TCGA data, converted 3D volumes to annotated 2D slices, and prepared them for YOLO11n in segmentation mode.
